# STEM: Stacked Threshold-based Entity Matching 

STEM is a software for entity matching (also known as deduplication, record linkage, link discovery...). STEM can be used to find duplicate records in your database, or to link a database to another by finding identical records. STEM does not implement entity matching from scratch, but it is based on already existing open source entity matching software.
Two alternative threshold-based entity matching systems are supported:

- [Duke] (https://github.com/larsga/Duke)

- [Silk] (https://github.com/silk-framework/silk)

STEM runs several instances of the base entity matcher with different threshold values and use their predictions as a feature vector for an SVM classifier. In this way, STEM is able to achieve high recall and precision at the same time.

##Dependencies

- Java 8
- Python 2.7
- Python libraries: numpy, scikit-learn, pandas, rdflib

##Getting started

STEM requires a configuration file of the base classifier and a gold standard. You also need to specify the number of instances N (e.g. 10) and the amplitude of the threshold perturbation a (e.g. 0.2). Try it:

    cd src
    python STEM.py -i ../config/FEIII2016/FFIEC_SEC.xml -g ../data/FEIII2016/gs/FFIEC-SEC-GroundTruth.csv -s duke -N 5 -a 0.2

When starting your own experiment, you need to choose whether you want to use Duke or Silk as a base classifier. Then, you need to produce a valid Duke or Silk configuration file. You also need to create a gold standard, namely a set of annotated matches that STEM will use to learn. This can be done manually or through the active learning module of Duke.
The Gold Standard needs to have this format:

    +,id1,id2,1.0
    -,id1,id2,1.0
    +,id1,id2,1.0 

where id1 comes from the first set of data and id1 from the second set of data to match. '+' stands for a correct match and '-' for an incorrect match.

You should organize the files in the following way:

- configuration_file: config/my_experiment/config.xml
- gold_standard: data/my_experiment/gs/gs.csv

Then using Duke:

    cd STEM/src

    python STEM.py -i ../config/my_experiment/config.xml -g ../data/my_experiment/gs/gs.csv -N 10 -a 0.2 -s duke

where config_file.xml is a valid Duke configuration file

or using Silk:

    python STEM.py -i ../config/my_experiment/config.xml -g ../data/my_experiment/gs/gs.csv -N 10 -a 0.2 -s silk

where config_file.xml is a valid Silk configuration file

You can also train the model, serialize it and load it in another moment:

    cd STEM/src

    python Serializer.py -i ../config/my_experiment/config.xml -g ../data/my_experiment/gs/gs.csv -N 10 -a 0.2 -s duke

or

    python Serializer.py -i ../config/my_experiment/config.xml -g ../data/my_experiment/gs/gs.csv -N 10 -a 0.2 -s silk

these will generate pickle files (my_model.pkl) that can be loaded without retraining using:

    python STEM.py -i ../config/my_experiment/config.xml -N 10 -a 0.2 -s duke -m ../models/my_experiment/my_model.pkl
or

    python STEM.py -i ../config/my_experiment/config.xml -N 10 -a 0.2 -s silk -m ../models/my_experiment/my_model.pkl

The generated output can be in a .csv format:

    id1,id2

or .nt format by specifying --rdf flag:

    <id1> <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#sameAs> <id2> .

or EDOAL format by specifying --edoal flag:

    <http://localhost/alignments#1> a align:Alignment;
      align:map [
        a align:Cell;
        align:entity1 <id1>;
        align:entity2 <id2>;
        align:measure "1.0"^^xsd:float;
        align:relation "="
      ].
